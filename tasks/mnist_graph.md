### Assignment: mnist_graph
#### Date: Deadline: Mar 24, 23:59
#### Points: 2 points

This assignment is a variant of `mnist_layers_activations`. Your goal is to
implement the same functionality, but this time using the
[mnist_graph.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/01/mnist_graph.py)
template which utilizes explicit `tf.Session` and `tf.Graph` instead
of a `tf.keras.Model`.
